## Planning Story
First the wireframe was made to get an idea of what the game board, buttons, and text would be at. Following the wireframe outline, the html lay out would first be designed with the basic needs of the website including any identifiers or classes in order to access the elements from the CSS or JavaScript. Then a bit of CSS would be implemented at first to make the gameboard, in order to test functionatlity as the JavaScript code was made. Then the game logic (functionatlity) would begin with making sure all the buttons on the html would fire off an event when clicked and would be able to do the action needed like signing up for an account or signing in to an account or starting a new game. Then create the ability to put X's and O'x on the board where ever a click was made, determine a winner, and removing the ability to click on a space where there is already an X or O.
